# My-first-software-development-repository
This software repository contains my first software for the module Software Development. It stores all of the related files including a README file which contains information about the software I have written

My name is Sidikiba Diane

So far I have learnt that the version control system is a crucial process as it allows one to renovate, add and correct issues with version{s} of a software or program. Changes are expected to occur after deployment, which can either be major changes or minor ones, depending on the issue at hand it is useful to save amendements and report the modification made to programs.
